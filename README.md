# prop-info-hud

This small & simple addon allows the player to view various info about the prop / entity they're looking at.

It shows:
  1. Owner ( uses CPPI )
  2. Entity class
  3. Color
  4. Material
  5. Model
  6. Angles ( rounded )

It also shows a little axis line indication to show angle offsets, red being forward, green up and blue to the right.

You can toggle it on and off using the console command "hudinfo_enable 1", by default it's at 0 thus off.

The addon is entirely client sided so it uses 0 server peformance.
